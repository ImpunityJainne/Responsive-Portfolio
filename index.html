      <p>I'll try almost anything at least twice; some of the best things in life can be a little intimidating the first time around.</p>

      <p>I tend to gravitate toward the quirkier folk, being a little of that myself. If you're nerdy, a geek, or a foodie, we'll get along splendidly! While I do appreciate some of the finer things in life (haute cuisine, wine tastings, fine furniture, and tasteful architecture/interior design), I'm definitely not above taking in and refurbishing that free couch on the curb. I also enjoy simple pleasures like making trips to the hardware store, getting lost while driving the back roads, and having nice, meaty conversations with interesting people.</p>
      
      <p>I like making things and finding solutions. I'm good with my hands, and I have mad skills in Microsoft Office that should probably embarrass me.</p>
